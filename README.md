# Adapative User Agent Swicther
Automatically switch User Agent based on display size (resolution) for those websites which still rely on User Agent to arrange layout.

My personal use case: on samsung z fold 5:
+ Cover screen => Default Android mobile UA
+ Inner screen => iPad (mini) UA
+ Dex mode => Desktop UA
